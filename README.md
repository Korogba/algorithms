Playground for implementing and experimenting with various algorithms

Implementation of various algorithms following the algorithms, [a 4-course specialization by Stanford University on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

Implemented using `Python` because not every time `Java`

You'd probably need to follow that course to understand most of the implementations here.
